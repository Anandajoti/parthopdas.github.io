<p>This is a list of the Jātaka Stories, together with a translation of the title (omitted in the standard translation), the section (nipāta) they fall into (1s, 2s, 3s, etc) with a synopsis of the story and a list of the characters that appear therein; together with links both to the text and the translation.</p>

<p>The text used is a modified version of the Burmese edition of the Aṭṭhakathā or Commentary. While preparing the text for publication I have updated all the references, which were non-standard in the original, and also added in alternate titles, either given in the commentary, which are placed in square brackets. i.e. JA 436 Samuggajātakaṁ [Karaṇḍakajātakaṁ]; or in other editions, like the Pali Text Society edition (PTS) or Sri Lankan Buddha Jayanti Tripiṭaka edition (BJT), which are given in normal round brackets, e.g. JA 438 Daddarajātakaṁ (Tittirajātakaṁ). </p>

<p>I have also updated the formatting to match more closely the standards used on this website, but because of the size of the text, this has only been partially completed. I hope enough to make for a better reading experience.</p>

<p>The translation was originally published by the Cambridge University Press, and is based on the PTS edition of the text, edited by V Fausböll. There are many variations and differences between this edition and the Burmese Chaṭṭha Saṅgāyana edition, so they do not match completely, please bear this in mind when comparing the two.</p>

<p>The order, and therefore the numbering, of the last eight of the Jātakas – which are also some of the most important – varies between editions. Occasionally names vary also, known variations have been included here, so it is comprehensive in regard to these three editions. </p>

<p>In the study I have added in some other previous lives of the Buddha, which are recorded in the Canon, but which are not in the Jātaka book itself. For a comprehensive overview of the parallels to the Jātaka stories, please see Grey’s A Concordance of Buddhist Birth Stories, published by the Pali Text Society (3rd edition, 2000).</p>

<p>Based on this work I have made a quick survey of the roles that are played by various people in the Jātakas, and the findings are below. This by no means answers all the questions that this table helps us to find, please use the work to add further to our knowledge of the Jātaka stories. </p>

<p>The most popular epithet for the Bodhisatta in these stories is as a <b>paṇḍita</b>, a wise man, animal or god (1, 3, 5, 22, 25, 27, 33, 36, 37, 39, 44, 46, 49, 63, 70, 74, 80, 89, 91, 92, 98, 107, 108, 110, 111, 112, 138, 158, 170, 176, 183, 184, 186, 189, 192, 195, 215, 223, 242, 247, 272, 280, 305, 316, 317, 324, 331, 332, 333, 336, 345, 350, 364, 452, 367, 368, 387, 396, 401, 402, 404, 413, 438, 440, 446, 454, 461, 463, 466, 467, 471, 473, 480, 481, 495, 497, 498, 500, 508, 510, 515, 517, 530, 532, 538, 540, 542, 546). He is also named in a similar role, as a teacher (<b>ācariya</b>, <b>sattha</b>), in the following stories: 8, 41, 43, 61, 64, 65, 71, 81, 97, 117, 119, 123, 124, 130, 161, 169, 175, 182, 185, 197, 200, 203, 245, 252, 271, 287, 353, 373, 453, 522. </p>

<p>Another role that is similar to that of the wise man is that of an ascetic, of various sorts, <b>tāpasa</b>: 17, 76, 77, 87, 106, 144, 154, 162, 166, 167, 173, 207, 234, 244, 246, 251, 259, 273, 281, 284, 285, 293, 301, 313, 319, 328, 334, 337, 338, 346, 348, 376, 392, 411, 414, 418, 425, 426, 431, 433, 435, 436, 440, 444, 488, 490, 496, 511, 526, 532, 538); sometimes he is an <b>ājivaka</b> (94); or a wanderer (<b>paribbājaka</b>) (235, 408, 443, 528); or a sage (<b>isi</b>): 66, 362, 523. </p>

<p>He also appears as the family priest (<b>purohita</b>) 34, 86, 120, 214, 216, 241, 310, 330, 377, 487. A purohita is, of course, a brahmin, and besides these occasions the Bodhisatta is also named as a brahmin (<b>brāhmaṇa</b>) in the following Jātakas: 65, 71, 155, 163, 174, 237, 290, 299, 354, 389, 403, 405, 422, 432, 442, 479, 481, 509. He is also mentioned as a brahmin student (<b>māṇava</b>) anumber of times: 163, 305, 356, 398, 405, 432, 467, 478. </p>

<p>The Bodhisatta is often a king or a prince (<b>rājā, kumāra</b>) 52, 62, 67, 73, 95, 96, 100, 126, 132, 151, 156, 160, 181, 191, 193, 194, 229, 230, 233, 240, 248, 257, 258, 260, 262, 263, 269, 276, 282, 289, 302, 303, 304, 326, 327, 343, 347, 349, 351, 355, 358, 371, 378, 406, 415, 416, 420, 421, 424, 428, 445, 459, 460, 461, 465, 468, 472, 494, 499, 504, 505, 507, 513, 519, 525, 527, 529, 531, 537, 539, 541, 542, 543, 544, 547. And many times he appears as a minister (<b>amacca</b>): 25, 26, 27, 79, 92, 107, 108, 158, 176, 183, 184, 186, 195, 215, 218, 223, 226, 247, 306, 320, 331, 332, 333, 336, 345, 396, 409, 462, 473, 495. </p>

<p>He also appears as a wealthy man (<b>seṭṭhi</b>): 4, 40, 45, 47, 53, 83, 84, 93, 103, 125, 127, 131, 164, 171, 232, 238, 261, 315, 340, 363, 382); a merchant (<b>vāṇija</b>) = 3, 44, 98, 249, 324, 365; a caravan leader (<b>satthavāha</b>): 1, 2, 54, 85, 256, 366, 493; a landlord (<b>kuṭumbika</b>): 39; or a valuer (<b>agghāpanika</b>): 5. He features also as a salesman: 63; horse-dealer: 254; mariner: 463; doctor: 69, farmer: 56, 189, watchman: 265. </p>

<p>Rarely he also appears as an outcaste (<b>caṇḍāla</b>): 179, 309, 373, 497, 498; or in low-caste jobs, as a <b>mahout</b>: 182; <b>potter</b>: 178; <b>stone cutter</b> 137; <b>smith</b>: 387; <b>carpenter</b>: 466; <b>barber</b>: 78; <b>acrobat</b>: 212; <b>drummer</b>: 59; <b>conch-blower</b>: 60. He is also a <b>gambler</b>: 91; and a <b>thief</b>: 318. </p>

<p>Some roles are either quotes from other Jātakas, or the same character appearing in more than one Jātaka: the Bodhisatta appears as the wise <b>Mahosadha</b> in 111, 112, 170, 192, 350, 364, 452, 471, 500, 508, 517 as well as this being the lead character in 542. </p>

<p>Many times the Bodhistta appears as <b>Sakka</b>, lord of the gods: 31, 202, 228, 264, 291, 300, 344, 372, 374, 386, 391, 393, 410, 417, 450, 458, 469, 470, 489, 512, 535; he is <b>Mahābrahmā</b>: 99, 101, 134, 135, 545; or a <b>deva</b> of some sort or other, often simply a witness to the action of the story: 18, 19, 38, 74, 82, 102, 104, 105, 109, 113, 121, 139, 146, 147, 187, 190, 205, 209, 217, 227, 243, 272, 283, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 307, 311, 360, 361, 369, 400, 412, 419, 437, 439, 475, 485, 492, 506, 518, 520, 524. </p>

<p>The Bodhisatta appears as an animal quite frequently, often as a king, and sometimes simply as a wise member, of the species. He is found as a <b>lion</b> 143, 152, 153, 157, 172, 188, 322, 335, 397, 486; <b>elephant</b> 72, 122, 221, 267, 357, 455, 456, 457, 514; <b>monkey</b> 20, 57, 58, 177, 208, 219, 222, 224, 342, 404, 407, 516; <b>deer</b> 11, 12, 15, 16, 21, 206, 359, 385, 482, 483, 501; <b>bull</b>:<b> </b>28, 29, 278: <b>buffalo</b>: 88, <b>ox</b>, 30, 88, 286; <b>horse</b> 24, 196, 266; <b>dog</b> 22; <b>jackal</b> 142; <b>pig</b> 388; <b>rat</b> 128; <b>mouse</b> 129; <b>iguana</b> 138, 141, 325; and <b>frog</b> 239.</p>

<p>Many times he is a <b>bird</b>, either generic: 36, 115, 133, 308, 321, 384, 521; or specifically, as a <b>goose</b>: 32, 136, 270, 370, 434, 451, 502, 533, 534; <b>quail</b>: 33, 35, 118, 168, 394: <b>partridge</b>: 37, 438; <b>pigeon</b>: 42, 274, 275, 277, 375, 395; <b>parrot</b>: 145, 198, 255, 329, 429, 430, 484, 503; <b>crow</b>: 140, 204, 292; <b>peacock</b>: 159, 339, 491; <b>vulture</b>: 164, 381, 399, 427; <b>cock</b>: 383, 448; <b>cuckoo</b>: 464, 536; or a <b>woodpecker</b>: 210; and in three stories he is a <b>fish</b> 75, 114, 236. </p>

<p>We can see that there are several stock roles that are assigned to people known from  Buddha Gotama’s life. Some are unsurprising: <b>Suddhodana</b> and <b>Mahāmāyā</b> often play his parents, either separately: 428, 500, 508; or together: 7, 35, 156, 163, 201, 452, 461, 509, 542, 547; <b>Rāhulamātā</b> (mostly named as such in the Jātakas) often plays his wife: 11, 95, 194, 201, 276, 281, 292, 328, 340, 387, 397, 408, 411, 415, 421, 424, 434, 443, 451, 458, 459, 461, 485, 506, 513, 525, 531, 539, 544, 546, 547, and she is once named as <b>Bimbā</b> in 542; and <b>Rāhula</b> himself is often his son: 9, 16, 95, 173, 188, 201, 250, 319, 354, 408, 444, 486, 525, 529, 539, 544, 546, 547. </p>

<p>Others are perhaps less obvious: as noted above, <b>Sakka</b> is quite often assigned to the Bodhisatta himself, but when it is not the Bodhisatta, it is usually <b>Anuruddha</b>: 194, 243, 316, 347, 429, 430, 441, 480, 485, 494, 499, 537, 540, 541, 546, 547, although on one occasion <b>Moggallāna</b> plays this role: 78. </p>

<p><b>Ānanda</b> is very often designated as the <b>king</b> in the story, and most times as the king of Benares (often named as Brahmadatta): 12, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 66, 70, 77, 78, 107, 120, 140, 149, 155, 158, 159, 164, 171, 176, 182, 183, 184, 195, 214, 215, 226, 243, 251, 254, 259, 284, 292, 309, 310, 334, 346, 368, 376, 377, 388, 391, 396, 398, 403, 409, 418, 425, 431, 443, 455, 465, 473, 474, 476, 478, 482, 483, 512, 521, 524, 540; though sometimes he is king of the Kurus (where named, he is Dhanañcaya): 441, 495, 496, 515, 546; the king of Pañcāla: 323, 503; the king of Kosala: 385; or a king of thieves: 282. Other male disciples often appear in these Jātakas, but in no specific roles, look up Sāriputta, Moggallāna, Kassapa.</p>

<p>Of the female disciples, <b>Uppalavaṇṇā</b> often gets to be a goddess: 382, 392, 414, 442, 470, 511, 535, 538, 539, 540; though she plays a variety of roles other than this also: sister (15, 397, 488, 513, 543), mother (16), an old woman (29), a queen (66), a courtesan (276), a daughter (354, 408, 527, 547), an iguana (438), a deer (501), a maynah (521), a wise woman (542), a princess (544), and as a nāga queen (546). <b>Khemā</b>, who was known for her wisdom, appears in 354, 397, 501, 502, 534, 539, in various roles. <b>Khujjuttarā</b>, who remembered the collection known as the Itivuttaka, appears as a nurse in 354, 488, 525, 531. </p>

<p>One character who appears quite often is <b>Devadatta</b>. Again, he plays various roles, but always as someone in opposition to the Bodhisatta: 1, 3, 11, 12, 20, 21, 33, 51, 57, 58, 72, 73, 113, 122, 131, 142, 143, 160, 168, 174, 184, 189, 193, 199, 204, 206, 208, 209, 210, 220, 221, 222, 224, 231, 233, 240, 241, 243, 277, 294, 295, 308, 313, 326, 329, 335, 342, 353, 357, 358, 367, 389, 397, 404, 407, 416, 422, 438, 445, 448, 455, 457, 466, 472, 474, 482, 485, 492, 503, 505, 506, 514, 516, 518, 542, 543, 544, 545, 547. Another villain who appears quite often is Devadatta’s follower, <b>Kokālika</b>: 117, 172, 188, 189, 272, 294, 331, 466, 481. </p>

<p>Sometimes stories in the Jātaka collection have parallels in other places in the canon, for instance, most of the stories of the <b>Cariyāpiṭaka</b> are retold in the Jātaka book: 9, 35, 75, 95, 224, 276, 278, 303, 316, 442, 443, 444, 455, 457, 460, 480, 482, 488, 497, 499, 505, 506, 510, 513, 524, 532, 537, 538, 540, 541, 543, 544, 547. Mahāgovinda’s story has no parallel in the Jātaka collection, but is found in DN 19. The last story in the Cariyāpiṭaka has no parallel in the collection: Cp 35 Mahālomahaṁsacariya. We find some of the stories retold in the <b>Vinaya</b>: 10, 25, 28, 81, 136, 137, 183, 253, 309. Mahāsuddasana’s story is told in the <b>Dīghanikāya</b> (DN 17), and appears also in Jātaka 95. </p>

<p>Outside of these sources the main stories I have been able to identify are listed below:</p>

<p class="Heading4x">Bv Buddhavaṁsa<br>
The Lineage of the Buddhas<br>
cf. the Jātakanidāna, which expands on these stories<br>
<a href="https://www.ancient-buddhist-texts.net/Buddhist-Texts/K10-JA/JA-000.htm#toc0">Pāḷi</a>&#x2003;<a href="https://www.ancient-buddhist-texts.net/English-Texts/Jataka-commentary/JA-Nidana.htm">Eng</a><br>
<a href="https://suttacentral.net/bv">Buddhavaṁsa Text</a></p>

<p>The Buddhavaṁsa details the twenty-four Buddhas prior to our Buddha Gotama, and mainly focuses on who they were, their lifespans, their disciples and other items that parallel the life of Gotama. The first of the Buddhas is Dīpaṅkara, and it is under him that Sumedha makes his aspiration to become a Buddha himself. At the time of the other Buddhas he receives confirmation of his aspiration. </p>
